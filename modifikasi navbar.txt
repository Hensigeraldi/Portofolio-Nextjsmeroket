Modifying the navbar section

1. Modifying the color of my navbar to match the appearance of my website.
2. Adjusting the width of the navbar before scrolling to make it smaller.
3. For mobile viewing, the iPad navbar isn't fully extended, so I fixed it to make it responsive.
4. Finally, the about, portfolio, skills, and certificates content were aligned with the navbar's right and left margins, making it responsive on mobile, iPad, and Mac OS.
